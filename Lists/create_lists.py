# Define 2 separate lists:
#
# First, define a list called my_stuff .
# It must be be at least 4 elements long.  The data is completely up to you,
# but it must contain at least 1 string and 1 float.
#
# Next, define a list called nums . It should be a list
# containing all the numbers between 1 and 99 (including 99).
# Don't type this out manually! Use what we learned at the end of the previous video!


# Define my_stuff
my_stuff = [1, "test", 6.55, 42]

# Define nums
nums = list(range(1,100))
